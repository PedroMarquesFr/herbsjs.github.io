We created an example repository, completely full stack so you can see the applicability of Herbs in a project closer to the real world.

Within this repository, you will find a front-end application, made in react consuming a back-end application, using herbsJS, the API is made in graphQL

So, you can start with HerbJS, taking a look at the [sample repository](https://github.com/herbsjs/todolist-on-herbs), or follow this documentation to get more knowledge of how to use herbsJS

## TO DO list on Herbs

This is a example on how to build a application using [Herbs](https://github.com/herbsjs).

### Using

This application consists in two parts:

- Backend: Is a GraphQL API usings Herbs [repository link](https://github.com/herbsjs/todolist-on-herbs/tree/master/backend)
- Frontend: Is a web application using react with hooks [repository link](https://github.com/herbsjs/todolist-on-herbs/tree/master/frontend)

In those links you will find how to use Herbs and build awesome API's and how to consume inside front-end applications
