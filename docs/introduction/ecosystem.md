Today we have 3 primary libraries and some glues which you can learn more about in our official github repository [herbjs in the github](https://github.com/herbsjs)

But we think it's worth highlighting the 3 main libraries of herbsJS: **suma, gotu e buchu**.

- **Suma** - It helps with single value validations. Extensible and error code only! In short, it does not validate schemes or objects, only unique values.

- **Gotu** - Gotu helps to define your business entities. 
Entities: they are the first natural place where we should aim to put business logic in domain-oriented applications.

- **Buchu** - JavaScript library of uniform, auditable and secure use cases. Influenced by Clean Architecture and Trailblazer
