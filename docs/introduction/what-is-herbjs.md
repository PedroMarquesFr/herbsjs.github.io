## Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture was created by Robert C. Martin and promoted in his book Clean Architecture: A Craftsmanâ€™s Guide to Software Structure. Like other software design philosophies, Clean Architecture tries to provide a methodology to be used in coding, in order to facilitate code development, allow for better maintenance, updating and less dependencies.

An important goal of Clean Architecture is to provide developers with a way to organize code in a way that encapsulates business logic, but keeps it separate from the delivery mechanism.

Clean Architecture was not the first software design concept that appeared, over time software architectures have been created with the same objective of solving a design principle known as SoC (separation of concerns).

You will hear a lot about Clean Architecture here, so I recommend reading the book and / or that you seek to delve into this subject: [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
